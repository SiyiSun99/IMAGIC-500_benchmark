Welcome to the official repository for **SynthCPHS**, a large-scale synthetic household survey dataset and benchmarking framework introduced in our NeurIPS 2025 paper:

> 📝 *"SynthCPHS: A 1-Million Sample Synthetic Household Survey Dataset and Benchmark for Missing Data Imputation."*

SynthCPHS replicates the structure of the **Consumer Pyramids Household Survey (CPHS)** and enables **reproducible research** in missing data imputation for structured tabular datasets.

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Guide to Reproduce Results

### 1. 🧹 Data Preprocessing

To split the dataset into training and testing sets, run:

```bash
python Preprocessing/train_test_split.py
```

- This will generate two CSV files (`C19_train.csv` and `C19_test.csv`) containing 24 features.
- The target variable (`cat_HEALTH2`) for train and test sets is stored separately in `C19_train_y.csv` and `C19_test_y.csv`.

### 2. 🎲 Generate Missingness (R Script)

Generate missing data scenarios using R:

```R
Rscript Generate_Missingness/sample_miss.R
```

- This creates datasets with simulated missingness according to predefined mechanisms.
- The target variable and machine-generated variables remain fully observed.

### 3. 🗂️ Create Missing Masks

To create binary masks indicating missing data points, run:

```bash
python Preprocessing/map_missing_mask.py
```

- Masks are saved as binary indicators (`0`: not missing, `1`: missing).
- You can delete the `data_miss` folder afterward if no longer needed, as masks in `data_miss_mask` will suffice for imputation.

### 4. ⚙️ Perform Imputation

Run imputation methods individually. For example, for Mean/Mode imputation:

```bash
python Python_code/mean_mode_impute.py
```

- Ensure the `base_path` in each script matches your directory structure.
- The script outputs imputed datasets and logs runtime.
- After each run, check the logs and use the entry with the highest `index_file`, representing average time across runs.
- For TabCSDI_impute, modify the `featuredim ` in `Python_code/TabCSDI_impute/parameters/config_TabCSDI.yaml`

### 5. 📈 Evaluation

To evaluate imputation performance:

```bash
python Evaluation/Imputation_performance.py
```

To evaluate downstream classification performance:

```bash
python Evaluation/Downstream_performance.py
```

- Runtime efficiency can be directly assessed via the runtime CSV files generated during imputation.
